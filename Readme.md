# Fun_Game 

Fun_Game is a text-based (also known as interactive fiction) adventure game, where all the interaction takes place through on-screen words. The game starts with the player waking up in a maze, as described in the beginning of the game. The player then submits simple commands to interact with the game world. The purpose of the game is to survive and find the way through the maze to safety.
The game world has several different areas, such as treasure room, graveyard, crossroad, to name a few. The player can move through these environments in a certain order.
There are various types of items in the areas that the player can collect through their journey. Having these items in the playerâ€™s inventory affects the gameplay.
There are two outcomes: the player will die if they make the wrong decision, but with the correct choices they can reach the exit of the maze.
